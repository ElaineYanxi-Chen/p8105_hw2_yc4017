## Packages

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

-   Read and clean the data
-   Retain line, station, name, station latitute/longtitude, routes
    served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance
-   Convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable

``` r
nyc_transit <- read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada, -c(exit_only, staffing, staff_hours)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Now we describe the characteristics of this `nyc_transit` dataset: \*
This datasets includes 19 variables for 1868 observations, however,
there seems to some repeating observations in this dataset. \* The
dataset contains variables such as the subway line, station names, the
station location expressed in latitude and longitude. \* The dataset was
first imported as a csv file, before the names were cleaned using the
`janitor` package so that all variables and observations follow the
snake case convention. We then selected only the variables of interest,
before mutating the entry variable from a character variable with `YES`
or `NO` responses to a logical variable with `TRUE` or `FALSE` reponses.
\* The data is not tidy since there is quite a bit of repeat with routes
served.
