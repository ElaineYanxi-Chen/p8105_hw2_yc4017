## Packages

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Problem 1: NYC Transit

-   We first read in the csv file and converted the column types for
    route8 to route 11 from double to characters to be consistent with
    the rest of the route variables.

-   Retain line, station, name, station latitute/longtitude, routes
    served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance

-   Convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
                       col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada, -c(exit_only, staffing, staff_hours)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

trans_ent = read_csv(
“data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv”, col_types = )

Now we describe the characteristics of this nyc_transit dataset:

-   This datasets includes 19 variables for 1868 observations, however,
    there seems to some repeating observations in this dataset.

-   The dataset contains variables such as the subway line, station
    names, the station location expressed in latitude and longitude.

-   The dataset was first imported as a csv file, before the names were
    cleaned using the `janitor` package so that all variables and
    observations follow the snake case convention. We then selected only
    the variables of interest, before mutating the entry variable from a
    character variable with `YES` or `NO` responses to a logical
    variable with `TRUE` or `FALSE` responses.

-   The data is not tidy since there is quite a bit of repeat with
    routes served.

Next, we will use the following code chunks to answer some questions
about the dataset.

``` r
nyc_transit_dist = nyc_transit %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

-   There are 465 distinct stations in NYC subway.

``` r
nyc_transit_ada = nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) 
```

-   There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

``` r
nyc_transit_ent = nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

-   The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance is 37.7%.

Finally, we reformat data so that the route number and route name are
distinct variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_a = nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route"
  ) %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.

``` r
nyc_transit_a_ada = nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route"
  ) %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

There are 17 distinct stations that serve the A train and are ADA
compliant.

# Problem 2: Mr. Trash Wheel

We will first read the excel sheet Mr. Trash Wheel from the Excel file
and clean it.

``` r
mr_trash = read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N550") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)))
```

We will then use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the
data for Professor Trash Wheel.
