## Packages

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

* Read and clean the data
* Retain line, station, name, station latitute/longtitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance
* Convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable

```{r}
nyc_transit <- read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada, -c(exit_only, staffing, staff_hours)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

Now we describe the characteristics of this `nyc_transit` dataset:
* This datasets includes `r ncol(nyc_transit)` variables for `r nrow(nyc_transit)` observations, however, there seems to some repeating observations in this dataset. 
* The dataset contains variables such as the subway line, station names, the station location expressed in latitude and longitude. 
* The dataset was first imported as a csv file, before the names were cleaned using the `janitor` package so that all variables and observations follow the snake case convention. We then selected only the variables of interest, before mutating the entry variable from a character variable with `YES` or `NO` responses to a logical variable with `TRUE` or `FALSE` reponses. 
* The data is not tidy since there is quite a bit of repeat with routes served.
